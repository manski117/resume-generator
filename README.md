# Easy Resume Generator by manski117

### Created via create T3 app using nextjs, typescript, react, tailwind, and daisyUI.

Got sick of finding pay-walled sites asking me to pay to generate a resume, so I built my own. 
Created both as learning project to test out using the T3 stack using create T3 App. 

Free for public use.

## How to use:
Go to the "New" page and fill out the forms there. 

Then click the "SAVE" button at the bottom to save your data, or "SAVE AND VIEW" to go to see a preview of your resume.

Finally, click "PRINT RESUME" at the bottom of the /print page when you like what you have. Or you can always return to the /new page to edit more. 

Data is saved using local storage, meaning it is only saved on *your* device. No data is collected by me or sold to random companies for malicious purposes. I'm just an aspiring developer trying to make something for fun, not cambridge analytica.
